- p. 1: Another key to their success is that Pragmatic Programmers take responsibility for everything they do. Being responsible, Pragmatic Programmers won't sit idly by and watch their projects fall apart through neglect.
- p. 2: Software development must appear close to the top of any list of careers where you have control.

> [!tip] Tip 3: You Have Agency

- p. 3: Pragmatic Programmers take charge of their own career, and aren't afraid to admit ignorance or error. This means being honest and direct. We can be proud of our abilities, but we must own up to our shortcomings - our ignorance and our mistakes.
- p. 4: In addition to doing your own personal best, you must analyze the situation for risks that are beyond your control. Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don't blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any and all of them may play a role, but it's up to *you* to provide solutions, not excuses.

> [!tip] Tip 4: Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses

- p. 5: Don't say it can't be done; explain what *can* be done to salvage the situation.
- p. 6: Researchers in the field of crime and urban decay discovered a fascinating trigger mechanism. A broken window Psychologists have done studies that show hopelessness can be contagious.

> [!tip] Tip 5: Don't Live with Broken Windows

- p. 7: Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then *board it up*. Don't let entropy win.
- p. 7: Don't cause collateral damage just because there's a crisis of some sort.
- p. 8: If you find yourself on a project where the code is pristinely beautiful - cleanly written, well designed, and elegant - you will likely take extra care not to mess it up.
- p. 8: Just tell yourself, "No broken windows"
- p. 9: You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing an dhow to do it. But ask permission to tackle the whole thing and you'll be met with delays and blank stares. Work out what you can *reasonably* ask for. Develop it well. Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. People find it easier to join an ongoing success.

> [!tip] Tip 6: Be a Catalyst for Change

- p. 10: It's often the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams. Don't be like the fabled frog. Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what's happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.

> [!tip] Tip 7: Remember the Big Picture

- p. 11: You can discipline yourself to write software that's good enough - good enough for your users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of mind.
- p. 11: The phrase "good enough" does not imply sloppy or poorly produced code. All systems must meet their users' requirements to be successful, and meet basic performance, privacy, and security standards. **We are simply advocating that users be given an opportunity to participate in the process of deciding when what you've produced is good enough for their needs.**
- p. 12: It is equally unprofessional to promise impossible time scales and to cut basic engineering corners to meet a deadline.

> [!tip] Tip 8: Make Quality a Requirements Issue

- p. 12: Don't spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and overrefinment. Move on, and let you r code stand in its own right for a while.

> [!tip] Tip 9: Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio

- p. 15: Learn at least one new language every year
- p. 16: Read a technical book each month. Read nontechnical books, too. Take classes. Participate in local user groups and meetups. Experiment with different environments. Stay current.
- p. 16: It's important to continue investing. Once you feel comfortable with some new language or bit of technology, move on. Learn another one. It doesn't matter whether you ever use any of these technologies on a project, the cross-pollination of ideas is important.
- p. 17: Get familiar with object orientation, for instance, and you'll write procedural programs differently. Understand the functional programming paradigm and you'll write object-oriented code differently, and so on.

> [!tip] Tip 10: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear

> [!tip] Tip 11: English is Just Another Programming Language

- p. 20: You need to understand the needs, interests, and capabilities of your audience.
- p. 20: By making the appropriate pitch to each group, you'll get them all excited about your project. As with all forms of communication, the trick here is to gather feedback. Don't just wait for questions: ask for them. Look at body language, and facial expressions.
- p. 20: "The meaning of your communication is the response you get"
- p. 20: Continuously improve your knowledge of your audience as you communicate.
- p. 21: Some people want a formal "just the facts" briefing. Others like a long, wide-ranging chat before getting down to business. What is their skill level and experience in this area? Are they experts? Newbies? Do they need hand-holding or just a quick tl;dr? If in doubt, ask.

> [!tip] Tip 12: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It

- p. 23: Pragmatic Programmers embrace documentation as an integral part of the overall development process. Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand - in the code itself. In fact, we want to apply *all* of our pragmatic principles to documentation as well as to code.

> [!tip] Tip 13: Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On

- p. 23: Commenting source code gives you the perfect opportunity to document those elusive bits of a project that can't be documented anywhere else: engineering trade-offs, why decisions were made, what other alternatives were discarded, and so on.
