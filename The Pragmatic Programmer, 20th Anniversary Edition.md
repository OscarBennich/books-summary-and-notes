## Preface
### What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?
- Early adopter / fast adapter
- Inquisitive
	- "That's neat - how did you do that?"
- Critical thinker
	- When colleagues say "because that's the way its done" [...] you smell a challenge.
- Realistic
	- You try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face.
- Jack of all trades
	- You try hard to be familiar with a broad range of technologies and environments, and you work to keep abreast of new developments.
